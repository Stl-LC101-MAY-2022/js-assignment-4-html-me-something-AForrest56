               <h2>Been there. Done that. Can we go back?</h2>
               <p>
                  In November of 2020 one of my sisters had planned to compete in the
               <a href="https://www.rundisney.com/events/disneyworld/wine-and-dine-half-marathon-weekend/">
               Disney Wine and Dine Half Marathon Weekend.</a>
             She had planned to take a weekend trip to Florida to compete in the race. She already 
            had the hotel figured out, the tickets for the race purchased and was just waiting to get 
            the plane tickets. 
            <br>
            Enter Covid-19!
            <br>
             Disney unfortunately cancelled the races for the health
             and safety of all people involved. My sister was left with a huge decision to make. Cancel
              a weekend Disney trip? That is not how this family rolls. Instead her and our mother got 
              on the phone with the Disney travel employees to come to an agreement.
              <br>
              When they called to ask if they could still visit, they were told about the hotel being shut 
              down during that time. Since less people would be traveling due to the virus risk, Disney 
              had plans to refurbish some parts of their property (a.k.a. the hotel!). Disney does there 
              best to help with guest experiences and they did not disappoint. They offered my mother and sister
               an upgraded hotel for the same dates and the same price! They also let them add 2 days to 
               the stay as well as add a few more people. WOOHOO! Disney Family Vacation!
               <br>
               Our travel plans were set! Mom, 4 daughters and 1 grand-daughter are going to Disney! From 
               November 5th to the 9th we would all stay at 
               <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/animal-kingdom-villas-kidani/">
                  Disney's Animal Kingdom Villas-Kidani Village.</a>
