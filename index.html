               <h2>Been there. Done that. Can we go back?</h2>
               <p>
                  In November of 2020 one of my sisters had planned to compete in the
               <a href="https://www.rundisney.com/events/disneyworld/wine-and-dine-half-marathon-weekend/">
               Disney Wine and Dine Half Marathon Weekend.</a>
             She had planned to take a weekend trip to Florida to compete in the race. She already 
            had the hotel figured out, the tickets for the race purchased and was just waiting to get 
            the plane tickets. 
            <br>
            Enter Covid-19!
            <br>
             Disney unfortunately cancelled the races for the health
             and safety of all people involved. My sister was left with a huge decision to make. Cancel
              a weekend Disney trip? That is not how this family rolls. Instead her and our mother got 
              on the phone with the Disney travel employees to come to an agreement.
              <br>
              When they called to ask if they could still visit, they were told about the hotel being shut 
              down during that time. Since less people would be traveling due to the virus risk, Disney 
              had plans to refurbish some parts of their property (a.k.a. the hotel!). Disney does there 
              best to help with guest experiences and they did not disappoint. They offered my mother and sister
               an upgraded hotel for the same dates and the same price! They also let them add 2 days to 
               the stay as well as add a few more people. WOOHOO! Disney Family Vacation!
               <br>
               Our travel plans were set! Mom, 4 daughters and 1 grand-daughter are going to Disney! From 
               November 5th to the 9th we would all stay at 
               <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/animal-kingdom-villas-kidani/">
                  Disney's Animal Kingdom Villas-Kidani Village.</a>

               <p>
                  The travel time to Disney is always the worst part. Don't get me wrong road trips can be fun, 
                  but 14+ hours is a long time. We normally drive to Florida from Missouri. I know, I know. That's 
                  a long drive. Why not fly? Well, for 6 or more people it is cheaper to drive. Unfortunately, 
                  this time, we did not have the time to spare for driving such a long distance. We decided to take 
                  a flight from Lambert Airport to Orlando's Airport the morning of November 5th! Did I mention that 
                  is the day after my birthday. Lucky me right? 
                  <br>
                  I am not fond of flying, but the airport was nice. We had to wake up quite early to jump on a 
                  non-stop flight to Orlando. After we got off the plane we had to catch a bus to our hotel. Not just 
                  any bus, the Disney's Magical Express! I have always wanted to ride one of these buses. The bus was 
                  much like any other similiar bus. Fabric seats, tv screen welcoming us to Disney's Magical Express, 
                  and of course a friendly driver. It was a short trip to the hotel, but also a check on the bucket list.

               <h2>Hotel.. I mean Resort</h2>
               <p>
                  We have been quite fortunate to have traveled to Disney World as a family mutliple times. This is 
                  definitely a memorable visit because of the AMAZING accomodations! We have always stayed in one of 
                  this cheaper resorts. There are 4 tiers of Disney resorts: Value, Moderate, Deluxe and Deluxe Villas.
                  The resort we got upgraded to is considered a Deluxe Villa. Not the most expensive place to stay, but 
                  definitely not something we could afford at regular price. The resort was beautiful! There were animals 
                  roaming outside of the resort building, like Giraffes and Zebra. The inside was just as 
                  amazing as the outside. The amount of detail that Disney puts into their resorts is outstanding!
